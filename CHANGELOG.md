# DandersFrames Changelog

## [4.0.6] - 2026-02-15

### Bug Fixes
* `/df resetgui` command now works — was referencing wrong frame variable, also shows the GUI after resetting
* Settings UI can now be dragged from the bottom banner in addition to the title bar
* Test mode frames now properly reset to global settings when exiting auto-profile editing
* Fix profile corruption when spec auto-switch triggers while auto-profile overrides are active — overridden values were being permanently saved into the profile
* Fix party frame mover (blue rectangle) showing wrong size after switching between profiles with different orientations or frame dimensions
* Fix GUI controls stomping auto-profile overrides — changing a slider/checkbox/dropdown while a runtime profile is active no longer causes frames to flash with the wrong values

### New Features
* Auto-profiles now activate at runtime — raid frame settings automatically switch based on content type and raid size
* Chat notifications when auto-profiles activate or deactivate
* Combat-safe profile switching — queued during combat, applied when combat ends
* Sidebar onboarding hint when entering auto-profile edit mode — highlights that all settings tabs are editable
* Orange star indicators on sidebar tabs that contain overridden auto-profile settings (visible during edit mode and when a runtime profile is active)
* `/df overrides` command — prints all overridden settings grouped by tab to chat
* Hover over override count on auto-profile rows to see a tooltip with full override details per tab
* Override indicators on controls during runtime auto-profile — star icon and global value shown on overridden settings so users know what's active vs what their global is
